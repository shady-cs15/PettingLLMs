pettingllms is an open-source framework for post-training multi-LLM agent systems via reinforcement learning. With pettingllms, you can compose cooperative or competitive agents, integrate them with diverse environments, train them using multi-agent RL (e.g., self-play, team rewards, credit assignment), and deploy them to real-world workflows.
